## What is EventLog?

EventLog is an append-only persistence layer to support Event Sourcing in your PHP project.

EventLog has the following defining characteristics:

- doesn't overly enforce the use of objects, for example, if you want to push an event onto a stream without declaring an object for it, you can.
- stores primitive types (strings, arrays) as JSON, will never resort to PHP serialisation of objects
- will never attempt to rebuild an object itself, but will give the tools to make it easier

## Requirements
